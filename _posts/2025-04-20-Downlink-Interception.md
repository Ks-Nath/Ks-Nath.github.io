# Downlink Interception - Deep Dive

<h4>DISCLAIMER: </h4>

This blog post is intended solely for educational and informational purposes. It does not promote, encourage, or condone any illegal activity, including unauthorized access to satellite systems or communications. The techniques, tools, and concepts discussed are shared to raise awareness about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and to promote responsible research and ethical hacking practices.

<h3>WHAT</h4>
Downlink interception is one of the most accessible and least legally ambiguous techniques within the satellite hacking spectrum. It involves capturing data transmitted from satellites to Earth — often without any need to transmit or actively interfere with systems. This passive form of surveillance can reveal everything from weather satellite imagery to unencrypted communication.

<h3>FREQUENCY BANDS USED IN SATELLITES</h3>
* L-Band (1–2 GHz): Used for GPS, Iridium, and some weather satellites.
* S-Band (2–4 GHz): Telemetry and scientific missions.
