# Downlink Interception - Deep Dive

<h4>DISCLAIMER: </h4> 

This blog post is intended solely for educational and informational purposes. It does not promote, encourage, or condone any illegal activity, including unauthorized access to satellite systems or communications. The techniques, tools, and concepts discussed are shared to raise awareness about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and to promote responsible research and ethical hacking practices.
Always ensure that any experimentation or research is conducted within the bounds of the law, with proper authorization, and in accordance with local, national, and international regulations.

<h4>TLDR : FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT.</h4>

<h3>WHAT</h3>
Downlink interception is one of the most accessible and least legally ambiguous techniques within the satellite hacking spectrum. It involves capturing data transmitted from satellites to Earth — often without any need to transmit or actively interfere with systems. This passive form of surveillance can reveal everything from weather satellite imagery to unencrypted communication.

<h3>FREQUENCY BANDS USED IN SATELLITES</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>L-Band (1–2 GHz): Used for GPS, Iridium, and some weather satellites.</li>
 <li>S-Band (2–4 GHz): Telemetry and scientific missions.</li>
 <li>C-Band (4–8 GHz): Broadcast and telecoms.</li>
	<li>X-Band (8–12 GHz): Military, radar, and deep space.</li>
 <li>Ku/Ka-Band (12–40 GHz): Modern broadband and HD TV.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What we are about to do </h3>
Decode real-time weather images from NOAA satellites (NOAA-15, 18, or 19) transmitting APT signals (~137 MHz) using an SDR (like RTL-SDR).

<h2>What You Need</h2>
<h4>Hardware:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>RTL-SDR USB dongle (or HackRF One)</li>
	<li>V-Dipole / QFH / Turnstile antenna tuned for ~137 MHz</li>
	<li>A laptop running Linux or Windows with WSL</li>
</ul>
<h4>Software:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>rtl_fm (comes with rtl-sdr tools)</li>
	<li>sox (for converting audio)</li>
	<li>WXtoImg (deprecated, but works)</li>
	<li>SatDump (actively maintained, GUI-based)</li>
	<li>predict or Gpredict (optional satellite tracking)</li>
</ul>
